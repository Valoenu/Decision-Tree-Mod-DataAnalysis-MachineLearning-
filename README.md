# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Decision Tree

Welcome to my machine learning project! I'm currently a student learning how to build models, analyze data, and improve my coding skills in Python. This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will churn based on their banking behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and encoding  
- Train-test split  
- Model training with a Decision Tree  
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Visualizing the decision tree and confusion matrix

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is:  
📁 `Churn_Modeling.csv`  
It contains data from a bank’s customers, including features like:

- Age  
- Balance  
- Credit Score  
- Number of products used  
- Whether the customer exited (churned)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas**, **numpy** — data manipulation
- **matplotlib** — plotting
- **scikit-learn** — model building and evaluation
