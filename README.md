# Decision-Tree-Mod-DataAnalysis-MachineLearning-
This script analyzes customer churn using a decision tree classifier. It includes data loading, preprocessing (dropping irrelevant columns, encoding), splitting into train/test sets, training the model, and evaluating it using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The decision tree is visualized.
